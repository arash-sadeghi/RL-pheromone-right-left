# RL-pheromone-right-left
Webots based simulation for aligning robot on gaussian pheromone. Project failed because of singulare and abstract data. For example, a sensor configuration can have two possible actions to take. So state space needs improvements.

states devider has no gap inside. but state jumps are happening 444444 easily cahnges to 353535
rewards better be associated with changes not exact amount of error. this will change the whole rewarding system for better
